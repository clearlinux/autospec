Autospec
========

autospec is a tool to assist in the automated creation and maintenance of RPM
packaging. It will continuously run updated builds based on new information
discovered from build failures until it has a complete and valid .spec file. The
tool makes use of mock to achieve this.

                        /etc/mock/clear.cfg.


Requirements
=============

In order to run correctly, ``autospec`` requires the following components:

* python3
* correctly configured mock

If ``autospec`` is not configured to use a license server, then it will use the
``autospec/license_hashes`` file -  which is a list of licenses to facilitate
automatic license detection during the scan of a tarball. For correctness,
license names should be in the SPDX identifier format. Each line in the file
constitutes a license definition, for example::

    750b9d9cc986bfc80b47c9672c48ca615cac0c87, BSD-3-Clause
    175e59be229a5bedc6be93e958a970385bb04a62, Apache-2.0
    794a893e510ca5c15c9c97a609ce47b0df74fc1a, BSD-2-Clause


Control files
==============
It is possible to influence precisely how autospec will behave in order to gain
fine control over the build itself. These files may be used to alter the default
behaviour of the configure routine, to blacklist build dependencies from being
automatically added, and such.

These files are expected to live in same directory that the resulting ``.spec``
will live.

Common files
------------

release
  This file contains the current release number that will be used in the
  ``.spec``. This is also bumped and generated on existing and new packages,
  respectively. This results in less manual work via automatic management.

$package.license
  In certain cases, the package license may not be automatically discovered.  In
  this instance, ``autospec`` will exit with an error. Update this file to
  contain the valid SPDX identifier for any license(s) for the package,
  replacing ``$package`` in the filename with the actual package name.

Controlling dependencies
-------------------------

buildreq_add
  Each line in the file provides the name of a package to add as a build
  dependency to the ``.spec``.

pkgconfig_add
  Each line in the file is assumed to be a pkgconfig() build dependency.  Add
  the pkg-config names here, as ``autospec`` will automatically transform the
  names into their ``pkgconfig($name)`` style when generating the ``.spec``.

requires_add
  Each line in the file provides the name of a package to add as a runtime
  dependency to the ``.spec``.

${custom}_requires_add
  Same as "requires_add" above, but instead of the Requires being placed on the
  ``main`` subpackage, they will be placed on the ``-${custom}`` subpackage.

buildreq_ban
  Each line in the file is a build dependency that under no circumstance should
  be automatically added to the build dependencies. This is useful to block
  automatic configuration routines adding undesired functionality, or to omit
  any automatically discovered dependencies during tarball scanning.

pkgconfig_ban
  Each line in this file is a pkgconfig() build dependency that should not be
  added automatically to the build, much the same as ``buildreq_ban``.  As with
  ``pkgconfig_add``, these names are automatically transformed by ``autospec``
  into their correct ``pkgconfig($name))`` style.

requires_ban
  Each line in the file is a runtime dependency that under no circumstance
  should be automatically added to the runtime dependencies. This is useful to
  block automatic configuration routines adding undesired functionality, or to
  omit any automatically discovered dependencies during tarball scanning.

${custom}_requires_ban
  Same as "requires_ban" above, but instead of the Requires being removed from
  the ``main`` subpackage, they will be removed from the ``-${custom}``
  subpackage.

.. note::

  Run time requirements are not assumed to be build time requirement
  If a package has the same build and run time requirement it must be added
  to both buildreq_add and requires_add.

Controlling the build process
------------------------------

extra_sources
  This file contains a list of extra files to be added to the ``.spec`` and
  optionally installed as well. Each non-blank and non-comment line should start
  with the file name as found in the Git directory, followed by arguments to be
  passed to the /usr/bin/install(3) command, with at least one argument starting
  with a slash, denoting the destination directory (there's no need for
  ``%{buildroot}``). If the install arguments are missing, Autospec will not
  generate an installation command and the package should specify how to install
  in the install_append file (see below).

configure
  This file contains configuration flags to pass to the ``%configure`` macro for
  autotools based tarballs. As an example, adding ``--disable-static`` to
  ``./configure`` for an autootools based tarball would result in ``%configure
  --disable-static`` being emitted in the ``.spec``.

configure_openmpi
  This file contains configuration flags to pass to the ``%configure`` macro for
  autotools based tarballs to configure openmpi builds.

configure32, configure64, configure_avx2, configure_avx512
  These files are appended to the ``%configure'' macro after the
  contents of the ``configure'' file above. They are used for 32-bit,
  regular 64-bit, AVX2 and AVX512 builds, respectively.

cmake_args
  This file contains arguments that should be passed to the ``%cmake`` macro for
  CMake based tarballs. As an example, adding ``-DUSE_LIB64=ON`` to
  ``./cmake_args`` would result in ``%cmake -DUSE_LIB64=ON`` being emitted in
  the ``.spec``.

cmake_args_openmpi
  This file contains arguments that should be passed to the ``%cmake`` macro for
  CMake based tarballs for openmpi builds.

make_args
  The contents of this file are appended to the ``make`` invocation. This may be
  useful for passing arguments to ``make``, i.e. ``make TOOLDIR=/usr``

make32_args
  The contents of this file are appended to the ``make`` invocation of the 32bit
  build. It is appended after the make_args content so 32bit specific overrides
  can be added.

make_install_args
  Much like ``make_args``, this will pass arguments to the ``make install``
  macro in the ``.spec``

make32_install_args
  Much like ``make32_args``, this will pass arguments to the ``make install``
  macro in the ``.spec`` for the 32bit build. Again it is appended after
  make_install_args so 32bit specific overrides can be added.

prep_prepend
  Additional actions that should take place directly after ``%prep``
  and before the ``%setup`` macro.  This will be placed in the
  resulting ``.spec``, and is used for situations where fine-grained
  control is required.

build_prepend
  Additional actions that should take place directly after ``%build``
  and before the ``%configure`` macro or equivalent (``%cmake``,
  etc.). If autospec is creating AVX2, AVX-512 or 32-bit, these
  actions will be repeated for each of those builds, This will be
  placed in the resulting ``.spec``, and is used for situations where
  fine-grained control is required.

make_prepend
  Additional actions that should take place directly after the
  configuring step and before the ``%make`` macro or equivalent. If
  autospec is creating AVX2, AVX-512 or 32-bit, these actions will be
  repeated for each of those builds, before their respective make
  steps. This will be placed in the resulting ``.spec``, and is used
  for situations where fine-grained control is required.

install_prepend
  Additional actions that should take place directly after
  ``%install`` but before the ``%make_install`` macro (or equivalent).
  This will be placed in the resulting ``.spec``, and is used for
  situations where fine-grained control is required.

install_append
  Additional actions that should take place at the very end of the
  ``%install`` section. This will be placed in the resulting ``.spec``,
  and is used for situations where fine-grained control is required.

install_macro
  The contents of this file will be used instead of the automatically detected
  ``install`` routine, i.e. use this if ``%make_install`` is insufficient.

subdir
  Not all packages have their ``Makefile``'s available in the root of the
  tarball.  An example of this may be cross-platform projects that split
  Makefile's into the ``unix`` subdirectory. Set the name in this file and the
  ``.spec`` will emit the correct ``pushd`` and ``popd`` lines to utilise these
  directories for each step in the build.

cmake_srcdir
 The contents of this file are a path to the source directory in which to run
 cmake for non-standard packages. This path is relative to the clr-build
 subdirectory, which is created directly below the source package's root.

build_pattern
  In certain situations, the automatically detected build pattern may not work
  for the given package. This one line file allows you to override the build
  pattern that ``autospec`` will use. The supported build_pattern types are:

  * R: R language package
  * cpan: perl language package
  * ruby: ruby language package
  * maven: Java language package
  * configure: Traditional ``%configure`` autotools route
  * configure_ac: Like ``configure``, but performs ``%reconfigure`` to
    regenerate ``./configure``
  * autogen: Similar to ``configure_ac`` but uses the existing ``./autogen.sh``
    instead of ``%reconfigure``
  * cmake: Traditional builds using CMake
  * qmake: qmake (Qt5) projects
  * make: Run ``make`` followed by ``make install``, skipping configure. Note
    that this is the fallback build pattern in case no other build patterns are
    autodetected
  * distutils3: Only build the Pythonic package with Python 3
  * meson: Build package with Meson/Ninja
  * golang: Build Go package
  * godep: A go dependency-only package
  * \[WIP\] cargo: Build Rust package with Cargo
  * \[WIP\] scons: Build package with Scons
  * \[WIP\] ant: Build package with Apache Ant

series
  This file contains a list of patches to apply during the build, using the
  ``%patch`` macro. As such it is affected by ``-p1`` style modifiers.
  Arguments to patch can be added after the patch filename.  For example:

  ```
  0001-my-awesome-patch.patch -d some/subdir -p1
  ```

golang_libpath
  When building go packages, the go import path will be guessed automatically
  (e.g. building ``https://github.com/go-yaml/yaml/`` would get
  ``github.com/go-yaml/yaml``). While this is handy, it's not always correct (in
  the previous example, the correct import path should be ``gopkg.in/yaml.v2``).
  This could be easily fixed by placing ``gopkg.in/yaml.v`` in this file,
  changing where the go bits will be placed.

service_restart
  Each line in the file specifies the full path to a systemd unit file
  installed by this package that should be restarted by clr-service-restart_.

.. _clr-service-restart: https://github.com/clearlinux/clr-service-restart

Controlling files and subpackages
---------------------------------

excludes
  This file is used to generate ``%exclude`` lines in the ``.spec``. This is
  useful for omitting files from being included in the resulting package.  Each
  line in the file should be a full path name.

extras
  Each line in the file should be a full path within the resulting package, that
  you wish to be placed into an automatic ``-extras`` subpackage. This allows
  one to keep the main package slim and split out optional functionality or
  files.

dev_extras
  Same as "extras" above, but instead of the files being placed in an
  ``-extras`` subpackage, they will be placed in the ``-dev`` one. Use this
  functionality to place files used only for development against this
  software that Autospec does not automatically detect.

tests_extras
  Same as "extras" above, but instead of the files being placed in an
  ``-extras`` subpackage, they will be placed in the ``-tests`` one. Use this
  functionality to place files used only for testing against this
  software that Autospec does not automatically detect.

${custom}_extras
  Same as "extras" above, but instead of the files being placed in an
  ``-extras`` subpackage, they will be placed in the ``extras-${custom}``
  subpackage.

${custom}_extras_requires
  Each line contains a subpackage names of other subpackages in the package.
  This is used when the ``extras-${custom}`` subpackage has a runtime
  requirement on a sibling subpackage.

  An example of the ``${custom}_extras`` and ``${custom}_extras_requires``
  being used together with::

    /usr/bin/foo

  in foo_extras and::

    data

  in foo_extras_requires will produce a spec file package
  section for example-foo-extras with the following content::

    %package extras-foo
    Summary: extras-foo components for the example package.
    Group: Default
    Requires: example-data = %{version}-%{release}

    %description extras-foo
    extras-foo components for the example package.

setuid
  Each line in this file should contain the full path to a binary in the
  resulting build that should have the ``setuid`` attribute set with the
  ``%attr`` macro.

attrs
  Each line in this file should specify mode, user, group and filename
  (space separated) which is translated into a full ``%attr`` macro
  line that will be included in the ``.spec`` to have fine-grained control
  over the permissions and ownership of files in the package.

  An example of a ``attrs`` file would contain::

    4755 root messagebus /usr/libexec/dbus-daemon-launch-helper

  which would translate to the following line in the resulting ``.spec`` file::

    %attr(4755,root,messagebus) /usr/libexec/dbus-daemon-launch-helper


Controlling test suites
-----------------------
By default, ``autospec`` will attempt to detect potential test suites that
can be run in the ``%check`` portion of the ``.spec``.

make_check_command
  Override or set the command to use in the ``%check`` portion of the ``.spec``.
  This may be useful when a package uses a custom test suite, or requires
  additional work/parameters, to work correctly.

Controlling miscellaneous spec metadata
---------------------------------------

description
  Provides content for the %description section, overriding the content
  autospec autodetects. This is useful if autospec cannot find proper content
  for the description, if one wants to customize the content for better
  presentation, etc.

summary

  Provides the main Summary: value of the package, overriding any automatically
  found values. Only the first line is used.

pypi.json
  Provides an alternative to reading the pypi api url for package metadata.
  provides, requires, summary, description and license information could be
  sourced from this file (see https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPIJSON) for more
  details on the structure.


Controlling flags and optimization
----------------------------------
Further control of the build can be achieved through the use of the
``options.conf`` file. If this file does not exist it is created by autospec
with default values. If certain deprecated configuration files exists autospec
will use the value indicated by those files and remove them.

The options that can be set in ``options.conf`` are as follows:

asneeded
  If this is option set, the ``.spec`` will disable the LD_AS_NEEDED variable.
  Supporting binutils (such as found in Clear Linux Project for Intel
  Architecture) will then revert to their normal behaviour, instead of enforcing
  ``-Wl,-as-needed`` in the most correct sense.

optimize_size
  If this option is set, the ``CFLAGS/LDFLAGS`` will be extended to build the
  package optimized for *size*, and not for *speed*. Use this when size is more
  critical than performance.

funroll-loops
  If this option is set, the ``CFLAGS/LDFLAGS`` will be extended to build the
  package optimized for *speed*. In short this where speed is of paramount
  importance, and will use ``-03`` by default.

insecure_build
  If this option is set, the ``CFLAGS/LDFLAGS`` will be **replaced**, using the
  smallest ``-02`` based generic flags possible. This is useful for operating
  systems employing heavy optimizations or full RELRO by default.

pgo
  If this option is set, the ``CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS`` will be extended to build the
  package with profile-guided optimization data. It will add ``-O3``,
  ``-fprofile-use``, ``-fprofile-correction`` and ``-fprofile-dir=pgo``.

use_lto
  If this option is set, link time optimization is enabled for the build.

use_avx2
  If this option is set, a second set of libraries, for AVX2, is built.

use_avx512
  If this option is set, an additional set of libraries, for AVX512, is built.

openmpi
  If this option is set, an additional openmpi package is built.

fast-math
  If this option is set, -ffast-math is passed to the compiler.

broken_c++
  If this option is set, flags are extended with -std=gnu++98.

allow_test_failures
  If this option is set it will allow test failures, and will still emit the
  ``%check`` code in a way that allows the build to continue.

skip_tests
  If this option is set the test suite will not be run.

no_autostart
  If this option is set the autostart subpackage (which contains all files
  matching /usr/lib/systemd/system/\*.target.wants/) will not be required by the
  base package.

conservative_flags
  If this option is set autospec will set conservative build flags

broken_parallel_build
  If this option is set, the parallelization is disabled during build.

use_clang
  If this option is set autospec will utilize clang. This unsets the
  funroll-loops optimization if it is set.

keepstatic
  If this option is set, then ``%define keepstatic 1`` is emitted in the
  ``.spec``.  As a result, any static archive (``.a``) files will not be removed
  by rpmbuild.

32bit
  This option will trigger the creation of 32-bit libraries for a 32-bit build.

nostrip
  This option will suppress the stripping of the created binaries.

verify_required
  This option will make package verification required for the build. This option
  is automatically set if package verification is ever successful, but can be
  turned off manually.

security_sensitive
  This options sets flags for security-sensitive builds.

so_to_lib
  This option causes package ``.so`` files to be added to the ``lib`` subpackage
  instead of the ``dev`` subpackage.

dev_requires_extras
  If this option is set, the ``extras`` subpackage is marked as a dependency of
  the ``dev`` package.

autoupdate
  This option indicates that the package is trusted enough to be automatically
  update to its newest available version when set to ``true``. This flag is
  intended to be used by tools running autospec automatically.

compat
  This option indicates the package is a library compatibility package and only
  provides versioned library files.

nodebug
  If this option is set, ``debuginfo`` is not created for this package.

Name and version resolution
===========================

``autospec`` will attempt to use a number of patterns to determine the name and
version of the package by examining the URL. For most tarballs this is simple,
if they are of the format ``$name-$version.tar.$compression``.

For websites such as ``bitbucket`` or ``GitHub``, using ``get$`` and
``v$.tar.*`` style links, the project name itself is used from the URL and the
version is determined by stripping down the tag.

CPAN Perl packages, R packages, and rubygems.org rubygems are automatically
prefixed with their language name: ``perl-``, ``R-`` and ``rubygem-``
respectively.

When these automated detections are not desirable, it is possible to override
these with the ``--name`` flag when invoking ``autospec``


Automatic license server support
================================
``autospec`` can optionally talk to a license server instead of checking
local hashsum files, which enables greater coverage for license detection.
The URL set in ``license_fetch`` is expected to be a simple script that
talks HTTP.

This URL should accept ``POST`` requests with the following keys:

hash
  Contains the SHA-1 hash of the potential license file being checked.

package
  The name of the package being examined

text
  The contents of the potential license file

Implementations return a *plain text* response with the SPDX identifier
of the license, if known. An empty response is assumed to mean that this
license is unknown, in which case ``autospec`` will emit the ``license_show``
URL. The implementation should show the now-stored license file via a
web page, and enable a human to make a decision on the license. This is
then stored internally, allowing future requests to automatically know
the license type when this hash is encountered again.


Integration of systemd unit files
=================================
``autospec`` can add most systemd template file types by having a file in the
filename.extension in the build directory. Supported extensions are:
``mount, service, socket, target, timer, path and tmpfiles``. The files will
be added as Source# entries and be installed to their appropriate system
location.
